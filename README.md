# Word Generator

Generates random words that don't exist in the dictionnary, but soud like them!
- similar to the ones in the English dictionnary (`/en`)
- similar to the ones in the French dictionnary (`/fr`)

It will also save the generated word in a DB. For French ones it will associate them with their **presumed** gender, tense and conjugation.
